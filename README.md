# PHP-CRUD-with-OOP-and-PDO

This project is a practice exercise for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP, focusing on creating a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using PDO (PHP Data Objects). The purpose of this project is to help you understand and apply OOP principles while implementing common database operations with PDO.

## Database Setup

To set up the required database for this project using the provided SQL file, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have MySQL installed and running.
2. Access PHPMyAdmin or any other MySQL database management tool.
3. Create a new database. You can choose a suitable name for your database.
4. Once the database is created, select it from the list of available databases.
5. Locate the employee_management.sql file in your project directory.
6. In PHPMyAdmin, click on the "Import" or "Import" tab.
7. Choose the employee_management.sql file to import.
8. Select the appropriate options if any are available (e.g., character set, collation, etc.).
9. Click the "Go" or "Import" button to import the SQL file and set up the database tables.

## Technologies Used

- PHP: Used as the programming language for implementing the CRUD functionality.
- MySQL: Used as the database management system to store and retrieve data.
- HTML: Used to create a simple user interface.
